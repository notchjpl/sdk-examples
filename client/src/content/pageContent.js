We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire! The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've. There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No.",
