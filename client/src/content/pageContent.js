Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!

We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire! The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've. There's another ship coming in. Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No.",
